            <li>6 slices bacon, cut in half</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
            <li>1/4 cup light corn syrup</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried onion flakes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Montery Jack cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub the chicken breasts with the seasoning salt, cover and 
                refrigerate for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, 
                deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until crisp. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the mustard, honey, corn syrup, mayonnaise 
                and dried onion flakes. Remove half of sauce, cover and refrigerate 
                to serve later. 
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the breasts in the 
                skillet and saute for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until browned. Remove 
                from skillet and place the breasts into a 9x13 inch baking dish. 
                Apply the honey mustard sauce to each breast, then layer each breast 
                with mushrooms and bacon. Sprinkle top with shredded cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and 
                chicken juices run clear. Garnish with parsley and serve with the 
                reserved honey mustard sauce.
