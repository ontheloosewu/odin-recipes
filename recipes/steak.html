            </li>
            <li>Once the skillet starts smoking, place the steak in and sear (depending on
                thickness/preferred doneness, give or take) for a few minutes on one side. 
            </li>
            <li>Flip the steak and sear the other side for about 2/3rds the time.</li>
            <li>While it's still cooking, toss in 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 sprig of
                each rosemary and thyme.
            </li>
            <li>Grab a spoon, tilt the skillet towards you and start basting the steak.</li>
            <li>After time is up, remove the steak and let it rest for 5 minutes. Enjoy.</li>
